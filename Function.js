// Understanding function in JS 

// function are used to run our code whenever we want at our desired time. Simply function means to give name to our code. For EG:

// console.log("Hello Coders!"); This runs our code instantly.

// BUT using function,
function abcd(){
    console.log("Hello Coders!");
}

abcd(); //we should call function name when we want to print it.
