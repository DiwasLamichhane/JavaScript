// Understanding Prototype

/*

when we create an Object or an Array, it contains a default property called prototype. 

1) open your console and create an object.

var obj = {
    name: "Diwas"
}

2) then type obj and dot, obj. in console

3) after typing obj. you will get to name (which we have written in object) and many other thing which we have not written, they are PROTOTYPE.

4) Every created objects and arrays in javascript contains prototypes by default.

var obj = {
    name: "Diwas"
}
