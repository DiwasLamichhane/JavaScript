// Differences between Var, Let & Const

/* 
Var:

-- var is from older version of javascript. i.e. es5
-- var is function scoped. example:

function abcd(){
    for(var i = 0; i<5; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
        console.log(i); // this is outside for loop but inside abcd function, this will also run without any error because it is inside function and var is function scoped.
}
abcd();

-- var add itself to the windows object.

Let & Const:

-- let and const is from new version of javascript. i.e. es6
-- let and const is braces {} scoped. Example:

function abcd(){
    for(let i = 0; i<5; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log(i); // this will be error because let is braces scoped, the value of i is declared in for loop and i can be print only inside for loop i.e { here }.
}

-- let and const doesn't add itself to the windows object.
